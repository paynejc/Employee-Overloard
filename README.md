## Installation
node index.js
## Usage
This is a very simple, straight forward manager. 
Choosing to view departments, roles, and employees will present you with just that data. However adding or modifying those things will yield different options. You can create new deparments. You can also create new roles but they MUST belong to a deparment. So always make sure that the deparment exist or create it. Creating a role also gives you the option of creating a salary for that role. Then lastly,  you can create a new employee and assign them a role and supervisor. Or you can modify a current employees role.
